    # 1. Production Target: Targets the small, secure runtime image
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: src/UrlShortner.RestApi/Dockerfile # Assuming this path is correct, but MUST use 'target: final'
      target: final 
      
    # 2. Volumes Removed: Source code should be baked into the image, 
    # volumes are unnecessary and insecure in production.
    
    # 3. Secure Secret Injection & Environment
    environment:
      # Inject the connection string from the shell environment variable 
      # (retrieved from AWS Secrets Manager)

      # 4. Standard Port Mapping: Map standard HTTP port 80 to container port 8080

    # 5. Stability: Ensure the container restarts if it crashes
    restart: always
